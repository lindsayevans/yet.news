    <main class="faq">
      <h2>lolwut?</h2>
      <p>
        Allows you to create a basic single-page website that answers any
        question (as long as it ends in 'yet?') with a simple Yes/No/Maybe
      </p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        I went through a period of manually creating a bunch of sites that did
        just that, but it seems like too much work to register the domain,
        create the page, setup hosting etc.
      </p>

      <h2>What's this 'Chaos mode' business?</h2>
      <p>
        When switched to 'On', anybody can change the answer to your question at
        any time
      </p>

      <h2>What about the password?</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to change your answer: make a note of the auto-generated
        password, or change to something more memorable
      </p>

      <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to delete anything at any time for whatever reason
      </p>

      <h2>Who the hell is behind all this?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://linz.id.au/" target="_blank">Lindsay Evans</a> - a web
        developer from Sydney, Australia
      </p>

      <h2>
        Can I steal the code? Make suggestions? Complain about the design?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/lindsayevans/yet.news/" target="_blank"
          >Sure</a
        >
      </p>

      <h2>I've found something offensive, can you take it down?</h2>
      <p>
        Probably, send the details to
        <a href="mailto:yet.news@linz.id.au">yet.news@linz.id.au</a>
